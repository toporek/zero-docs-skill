# Previews

Per-Branch Preview URLs

# Previews

Most teams deploying to platforms like Vercel use unique hostnames per preview build. Zero supports this directly, and you do not need one `zero-cache` instance per preview deployment.

## Overview

Preview support has two parts:

1. Configure `zero-cache` with allowed URL patterns for both query and mutate endpoints.
2. In the browser, pick the concrete `queryURL` and `mutateURL` based on the current hostname when constructing `Zero`.

You must do this for both endpoints.

## Configure Allowed Endpoint Patterns

Set `ZERO_QUERY_URL` and `ZERO_MUTATE_URL` to include your production URL and your preview URL pattern:

```bash
ZERO_QUERY_URL="https://myapp.com/api/zero/query,https://my-app-*.preview.myapp.com/api/zero/query"
ZERO_MUTATE_URL="https://myapp.com/api/zero/mutate,https://my-app-*.preview.myapp.com/api/zero/mutate"
```

`zero-cache` will only allow client-selected URLs that match one of the configured values/patterns.

## Choose Endpoint URLs in the Client

When you construct `Zero` on the client, derive URLs from `location.origin` and pass both `queryURL` and `mutateURL`:

```ts
function getZeroEndpoints() {
  const origin = location.origin
  return {
    queryURL: `${origin}/api/zero/query`,
    mutateURL: `${origin}/api/zero/mutate`
  }
}

const {queryURL, mutateURL} = getZeroEndpoints()

const zero = new Zero({
  schema,
  userID,
  auth,
  queryURL,
  mutateURL
})
```

For full URL pattern syntax details, see [Queries URL Patterns](queries.md#url-patterns).

## Schema Changes in Previews

If a preview includes a schema change, you should implement the schema change **first** and do it in the same backwards-compatible way documented in [Schema Changes](schema.md#schema-changes) (`expand → migrate → contract`). After that, implement the rest of the preview behavior.

In practice, this means:

1. Apply the compatible schema expansion first.
2. Ship the preview app/API behavior as a preview, using the new schema.
3. Run contract cleanup later, after old clients are gone.

If desired, previews can share a single staging database.

Neon-style per-preview database branching is not well supported with Zero today, because each upstream database typically needs its own `zero-cache`.
