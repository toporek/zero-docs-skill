# Zero Schema

Zero applications have both a _database schema_ (the normal backend schema all web apps have) and a _Zero schema_.

The Zero schema is conventionally located in `schema.ts` in your app's source code. The Zero schema serves two purposes:

1. Provide typesafety for ZQL queries
2. Define first-class relationships between tables

The Zero schema is usually generated from your backend schema, but can be defined by hand for more control.

## Generating from Database

If you use Drizzle or Prisma ORM, you can generate `schema.ts` with [`drizzle-zero`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/drizzle-zero) or [`prisma-zero`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prisma-zero):

<CodeGroup
  labels={[
    {
      text: 'Drizzle',
      sync: {orm: 'drizzle', pgClient: 'drizzle'},
    },
    {
      text: 'Prisma',
      sync: {orm: 'prisma', pgClient: 'prisma'},
    }, 
  ]}
>

```bash
npm install -D drizzle-zero
npx drizzle-zero generate
```

```bash
pnpm add -D drizzle-zero
pnpm exec drizzle-zero generate
```

```bash
bun add -D drizzle-zero
bunx drizzle-zero generate
```

```bash
yarn add -D drizzle-zero
yarn exec drizzle-zero generate
```

```bash
npm install -D prisma-zero
# Add this to your prisma schema:
# generator zero {
#   provider = "prisma-zero"
# }
npx prisma generate
```

```bash
pnpm add -D prisma-zero
# Add this to your prisma schema:
# generator zero {
#   provider = "prisma-zero"
# }
pnpx prisma generate
```

```bash
bun add -D prisma-zero
# Add this to your prisma schema:
# generator zero {
#   provider = "prisma-zero"
# }
bunx prisma generate
```

```bash
yarn add -D prisma-zero
# Add this to your prisma schema:
# generator zero {
#   provider = "prisma-zero"
# }
yarn prisma generate
```

## Writing by Hand

You can also write Zero schemas by hand for full control.

### Table Schemas

Use the `table` function to define each table in your Zero schema:

```tsx

const user = table('user')
  .columns({
    id: string(),
    name: string(),
    partner: boolean()
  })
  .primaryKey('id')
```

Column types are defined with the `boolean()`, `number()`, `string()`, `json()`, and `enumeration()` helpers. See [Column Types](/docs/postgres-support#column-types) for how database types are mapped to these types.

#### Name Mapping

Use `from()` to map a TypeScript table or column name to a different database name:

```ts
const userPref = table('userPref')
  // Map TS "userPref" to DB name "user_pref"
  .from('user_pref')
  .columns({
    id: string(),
    // Map TS "orgID" to DB name "org_id"
    orgID: string().from('org_id')
  })
```

#### Multiple Schemas

You can also use `from()` to access other Postgres schemas:

```ts
// Sync the "event" table from the "analytics" schema.
const event = table('event').from('analytics.event')
```

#### Optional Columns

Columns can be marked _optional_. This corresponds to the SQL concept `nullable`.

```tsx
const user = table('user')
  .columns({
    id: string(),
    name: string(),
    nickName: string().optional()
  })
  .primaryKey('id')
```

An optional column can store a value of the specified type or `null` to mean _no value_.

> **Null and undefined**
>
> Note that `null` and `undefined` mean different things when working with Zero rows.
>
>     - When reading, if a column is `optional`, Zero can return `null` for that field. `undefined` is not used at all when Reading from Zero.
>     - When writing, you can specify `null` for an optional field to explicitly write `null` to the datastore, unsetting any previous value.
>     - For `create` and `upsert` you can set optional fields to `undefined` (or leave the field off completely) to take the default value as specified by backend schema for that column. For `update` you can set any non-PK field to `undefined` to leave the previous value unmodified.

#### Enumerations

Use the `enumeration` helper to define a column that can only take on a specific set of values. This is most often used alongside an [`enum` Postgres column type](/docs/postgres-support#column-types).

```tsx

const user = table('user')
  .columns({
    id: string(),
    name: string(),
    mood: enumeration<'happy' | 'sad' | 'taco'>()
  })
  .primaryKey('id')
```

#### Custom JSON Types

Use the `json` helper to define a column that stores a JSON-compatible value:

```tsx

const user = table('user')
  .columns({
    id: string(),
    name: string(),
    settings: json<{theme: 'light' | 'dark'}>()
  })
  .primaryKey('id')
```

#### Compound Primary Keys

Pass multiple columns to `primaryKey` to define a compound primary key:

```ts
const user = table('user')
  .columns({
    orgID: string(),
    userID: string(),
    name: string()
  })
  .primaryKey('orgID', 'userID')
```

### Relationships

Use the `relationships` function to define relationships between tables. Use the `one` and `many` helpers to define singular and plural relationships, respectively:

```ts
const messageRelationships = relationships(
  message,
  ({one, many}) => ({
    sender: one({
      sourceField: ['senderID'],
      destField: ['id'],
      destSchema: user
    }),
    replies: many({
      sourceField: ['id'],
      destSchema: message,
      destField: ['parentMessageID']
    })
  })
)
```

This creates "sender" and "replies" relationships that can later be queried with the [`related` ZQL clause](/docs/zql#relationships):

```ts
const messagesWithSenderAndReplies = z.query.messages
  .related('sender')
  .related('replies')
```

This will return an object for each message row. Each message will have a `sender` field that is a single `User` object or `null`, and a `replies` field that is an array of `Message` objects.

#### Many-to-Many Relationships

You can create many-to-many relationships by chaining the relationship definitions. Assuming `issue` and `label` tables, along with an `issueLabel` junction table, you can define a `labels` relationship like this:

```ts
const issueRelationships = relationships(
  issue,
  ({many}) => ({
    labels: many(
      {
        sourceField: ['id'],
        destSchema: issueLabel,
        destField: ['issueID']
      },
      {
        sourceField: ['labelID'],
        destSchema: label,
        destField: ['id']
      }
    )
  })
)
```

> **Only two levels of chaining are supported**
>
> See https://bugs.rocicorp.dev/issue/3454.

#### Compound Keys Relationships

Relationships can traverse compound keys. Imagine a `user` table with a compound primary key of `orgID` and `userID`, and a `message` table with a related `senderOrgID` and `senderUserID`. This can be represented in your schema with:

```ts
const messageRelationships = relationships(
  message,
  ({one}) => ({
    sender: one({
      sourceField: ['senderOrgID', 'senderUserID'],
      destSchema: user,
      destField: ['orgID', 'userID']
    })
  })
)
```

#### Circular Relationships

Circular relationships are fully supported:

```tsx
const commentRelationships = relationships(
  comment,
  ({one}) => ({
    parent: one({
      sourceField: ['parentID'],
      destSchema: comment,
      destField: ['id']
    })
  })
)
```

### Database Schemas

Use `createSchema` to define the entire Zero schema:

```tsx

  tables: [user, medium, message],
  relationships: [
    userRelationships,
    mediumRelationships,
    messageRelationships
  ]
})
```

### Register Schema Type

Use `DefaultTypes` to register the your `Schema` type with Zero:

```ts
declare module '@rocicorp/zero' {
  interface DefaultTypes {
    schema: Schema
  }
}
```

This prevents having to pass `Schema` manually to every Zero API.

## Schema Changes

Zero applications have three components that interact with the database schema: Postgres, the API server (query/mutate endpoints), and the client.

### Development

During development, you can make changes to all three components in any order:

- Change the Postgres schema
- Update the API server to use the new schema
- Update client code to use the new schema

If the Zero client ever detects that its schema is incompatible with the server, it disconnects and fires the [`onUpdateNeeded` event](#handling-old-clients). If the API server ever detects that it has an incompatible schema, it will fail with an error. Simply reloading the app fixes both issues.

### Production

Zero also supports downtime-free schema changes for use in production. To achieve this, the order you deploy in matters:

- **Expand** (adding things): Deploy providers before consumers. DB → API → Client.
- **Contract** (removing things): Deploy consumers before providers. Client → API → DB.

> **Test on staging first**
>
> For production apps, we strongly recommend testing schema
>   changes on a staging environment that has a
>   production-like dataset before deploying to production.

### Expand Changes

When you're adding a column, table, or new mutator/query:

1. Deploy the database change and wait for it to replicate through `zero-cache`.
   - In Cloud Zero, you can see replication status in the dashboard.
   - In self-hosted `zero-cache`, check the logs.
   - If there's [backfill](#backfill), wait for that to complete.
2. Deploy the API server.
3. Deploy the client.

> **Custom publications + Supabase**
>
> If you use a [custom
>   publication](postgres-support#limiting-replication) with
>   Supabase, you need to [manually notify
>   `zero-cache`](connecting-to-postgres#publication-changes)
>   of changes to your publication.

For full-stack frameworks where the API and client deploy together, steps 2 and 3 are combined.

If your change doesn't affect the Postgres schema (for example, just adding a mutator that uses existing columns), skip step 1. If your change doesn't affect the API server, skip step 2.

> **Incorrect deployment order will cause downtime**
>
> If you deploy the API server before the schema change has replicated, mutators and/or queries will fail because they will refer to non-existent columns.
>
> If you deploy the client before the API change, the client will call mutators/queries that don't exist yet.
>
> Both these issues will cause Zero to go into an [error](/docs/connection#error) state. The user can manually reload to recover from this as soon as the depended-upon component has been deployed.

### Contract Changes

When you're removing a column, table, or mutator/query:

1. Deploy the client (stop using the thing being removed).
2. Deploy the API server (stop providing the thing being removed).
3. Deploy the database change.

> **Handling old clients**
>
> When a client connects to `zero-cache`, it sends the schema it was built against. If that schema is incompatible with what `zero-cache` has (for example if server has just contracted), the client receives an error and calls `onUpdateNeeded`:
>
> ```ts
> new Zero({
>   // Optional. By default calls location.reload()
>   onUpdateNeeded: reason => {
>     if (reason.type === 'SchemaVersionNotSupported') {
>       // Show a banner prompting the user to update
>     }
>   }
> })
> ```
>
> By default `onUpdateNeeded` calls `location.reload()` if available. On the web, this will reload the page and the user will get the new code.
>
> For native apps or web apps that want a smoother experience, provide a custom `onUpdateNeeded` callback.

### Compound Changes

Some changes are both expand and contract—like renaming a column or changing a mutator's interface.

For these, you run both patterns in sequence:

1. **Expand**: Add the new column/mutator. Optionally backfill data and add a trigger to keep the old column in sync.
2. **Contract**: Remove the old column/mutator.

### Examples

#### Adding a Column

Add a `bio` column to the `users` table:

1. **Add column to database**

   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN bio TEXT;
   ```

   Wait for replication.

2. **Deploy API server**
   - Add `bio` to schema.ts
   - Add any new queries that read `bio`
   - Add any new mutators that write to `bio`
   - Deploy

3. **Deploy client**
   - Update app code to display/edit `bio`
   - Deploy

For full-stack frameworks, steps 2 and 3 are a single deploy.

Even when the API server and client are separate, they can be deployed in sequence by CI using a single PR. The client just can't be deployed until the API server is complete.

#### Removing a Column

Remove the `bio` column from the `users` table:

1. **Deploy client**
   - Remove `bio` from app code
   - Deploy

2. **Deploy API server**
   - Remove mutators that write to `bio`
   - Remove queries that read `bio`
   - Remove `bio` from schema.ts
   - Deploy

3. **Remove column from database**
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE users DROP COLUMN bio;
   ```

#### Renaming a Column

Rename `nickname` to `displayName`:

1. **Add new column with trigger**

   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN display_name TEXT;
   UPDATE users SET display_name = nickname;

   CREATE FUNCTION sync_display_name() RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
   BEGIN
     IF TG_OP = 'INSERT' THEN
       -- On insert, sync whichever column was provided
       IF NEW.display_name IS NULL AND NEW.nickname IS NOT NULL THEN
         NEW.display_name := NEW.nickname;
       ELSIF NEW.nickname IS NULL AND NEW.display_name IS NOT NULL THEN
         NEW.nickname := NEW.display_name;
       END IF;
     ELSE -- UPDATE
       -- Sync whichever column changed
       IF NEW.display_name IS DISTINCT FROM OLD.display_name AND
          NEW.nickname IS NOT DISTINCT FROM OLD.nickname THEN
         NEW.nickname := NEW.display_name;
       ELSIF NEW.nickname IS DISTINCT FROM OLD.nickname AND
             NEW.display_name IS NOT DISTINCT FROM OLD.display_name THEN
         NEW.display_name := NEW.nickname;
       END IF;
     END IF;
     RETURN NEW;
   END;
   $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

   CREATE TRIGGER sync_display_name_trigger
     BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE ON users
     FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION sync_display_name();
   ```

   Wait for replication.

2. **Deploy app using new column**
   - Add `displayName` to schema.ts
   - Update app code to read/write `displayName`
   - Update queries to read/write `displayName`
   - Update mutators to use `displayName`
   - Deploy API → Client

3. **Remove old column**
   - Remove `nickname` from schema.ts
   - Deploy Client → API
   - Drop trigger and old column:
   ```sql
   DROP TRIGGER sync_display_name_trigger ON users;
   DROP FUNCTION sync_display_name();
   ALTER TABLE users DROP COLUMN nickname;
   ```

#### Making a Column Optional

Change `nickname` from required to optional:

The safest approach is to treat this like a rename—create a new nullable column:

1. **Add new nullable column with trigger**

   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN nickname_v2 TEXT;  -- nullable
   UPDATE users SET nickname_v2 = nickname;

   CREATE FUNCTION sync_nickname() RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
   BEGIN
     IF TG_OP = 'INSERT' THEN
       -- On insert, sync whichever column was provided
       IF NEW.nickname_v2 IS NULL AND NEW.nickname IS NOT NULL THEN
         NEW.nickname_v2 := NEW.nickname;
       ELSIF NEW.nickname IS NULL AND NEW.nickname_v2 IS NOT NULL THEN
         NEW.nickname := COALESCE(NEW.nickname_v2, '');  -- default for old clients
       END IF;
     ELSE -- UPDATE
       -- Sync whichever column changed
       IF NEW.nickname_v2 IS DISTINCT FROM OLD.nickname_v2 AND
          NEW.nickname IS NOT DISTINCT FROM OLD.nickname THEN
         NEW.nickname := COALESCE(NEW.nickname_v2, '');  -- default for old clients
       ELSIF NEW.nickname IS DISTINCT FROM OLD.nickname AND
             NEW.nickname_v2 IS NOT DISTINCT FROM OLD.nickname_v2 THEN
         NEW.nickname_v2 := NEW.nickname;
       END IF;
     END IF;
     RETURN NEW;
   END;
   $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

   CREATE TRIGGER sync_nickname_trigger
     BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE ON users
     FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION sync_nickname();
   ```

   Wait for replication.

2. **Deploy app using new column**
   - Add `nicknameV2` to schema.ts as `optional()`
   - Update app code to handle nulls
   - Deploy API → Client

3. **Remove old column**
   - Remove `nickname` from schema.ts
   - Rename `nickname_v2` to `nickname` if desired (another rename cycle), or keep the new name
   - Deploy Client → API
   - Drop trigger and old column

### Backfill

When you add a new column or table to your schema, initial data (from e.g., `GENERATED`, `DEFAULT`, `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`, etc.) needs to be replicated to `zero-cache` and synced to clients.

Similarly, when adding an existing column to a [custom publication](/docs/postgres-support#zero-cache-replication), that column's existing data needs to be replicated.

Zero handles both these cases through a process called _backfilling_.

Zero backfills existing data to the replica in the background after detecting a new column. The new column is not exposed to the client until all data has been backfilled, which may take some time depending on the amount of data.

### Monitoring Backfill Progress

To track backfill progress, check your `zero-cache` logs for messages about backfilling status.

If you're using [Cloud Zero](https://zerosync.dev/#pricing), backfill progress is displayed directly in the dashboard.
