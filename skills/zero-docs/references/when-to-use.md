# When To Use Zero

And When Not To – A Quick Guide

# When To Use Zero

Every tool has tradeoffs. This page will help you understand if Zero is a good fit for what you're building.

## Zero Might be a Good Fit

### You want to sync only a small subset of data to client

Zero's query-driven sync is a powerful solution for partial sync. You can define the data you want to sync with a set of Zero queries. By using partial sync, Zero apps can commonly load in \< 1s, yet still maintain the interaction perf of sync.

### You need fine-grained read or write permissions

Zero's [mutators](mutators.md) allow you to run arbitrary authorization, validation, or business logic on the write path. You can enforce that a write depends on what group a user is in, what has been shared with them, their role, etc. [Read permissions](auth.md#read-permissions) are very expressive, allowing similar control over what data is synced to the client.

### You are building a traditional client-server web app

Zero was designed from the ground up to be as close to a classic web app as a sync engine can be. If you have a traditional web app, you can try Zero side-by-side with your existing REST or GraphQL API, and incrementally migrate over time.

### You use PostgreSQL

Some tools in our space require you to use a non-standard backend database or data model. Zero works with PostgreSQL, and uses your existing schema.

### Your app is broadly "like Linear"

Zero is currently best suited for productivity apps with lots of interactivity.

### Interaction performance is very important to you

Zero was built by people obsessed with interaction performance. If you share this goal you'll be going with the grain of Zero's design choices.

## Zero Might Not be a Good Fit

### You need the privacy or data ownership benefits of local-first

Zero is not [local-first](https://www.inkandswitch.com/essay/local-first/). It's a client-server system with an authoritative server.

### You need to support offline writes or long periods offline

Zero doesn't support [offline writes](connection.md#offline).

### You are building a native mobile app

Zero is written in TypeScript and only supports TypeScript clients.

### The total backend dataset is > \~100GB

Zero stores a replica of your database (at least the subset you want to be syncable to clients) in a SQLite database owned by zero-cache.

Zero's query engine is built assuming very fast local access to this replica (i.e., attached NVMe). But other setups are technically supported and work for smaller data.

The ultimate size limit on the database that Zero can work with is the size limit of this SQLite database. So [up to 45TB on EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/) at time of writing.

However, most of our customers today use Zero with smaller datasets. We currently recommend Zero for use with datasets less than 100GB. If you want to work with larger datasets, please [reach out](https://discord.rocicorp.dev) and we can talk it through with you.

## Zero Might Not be a Good Fit **Yet**

Please see [our roadmap](status.md#roadmap) for high-priority upcoming Zero features.

## Alternatives

If Zero isn't right for you, here are some good alternatives to consider:

* [Automerge](https://automerge.org/): Local-first, CRDT-based solution. Pioneering branch-based offline support.
* [Convex](https://www.convex.dev/): Not a sync engine (reads and writes are server-first), but a very nice reactive database that is in GA.
* [Ditto](https://www.ditto.com/): CRDT-based, with high quality offline support.
* [Electric](https://electric-sql.com/): Postgres-based sync engine with a SaaS cloud.
* [LiveStore](https://livestore.dev/): Interesting event sourced design from one of the founders of Prisma.
* [Jazz](https://jazz.tools/): Batteries-included local-first.
* [PowerSync](https://powersync.com/): Sync engine that works with Postgres, MySQL, and MongoDB.
