# Connecting to Postgres

In the future, Zero will work with many different backend databases. Today only Postgres is supported. Specifically, Zero requires Postgres v15.0 or higher, and support for [logical replication](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/logical-replication.html).

Here are some common Postgres options and what we know about their support level:

| Postgres                 | Support Status                                             |

## Event Triggers

Zero uses Postgres “[Event Triggers](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createeventtrigger.html)” when possible to implement high-quality, efficient [schema migration](/docs/schema#schema-changes).

Some hosted Postgres providers don't provide access to Event Triggers.

Zero still works out of the box with these providers, but for correctness, any schema change triggers a full reset of all server-side and client-side state. For small databases (< 10GB) this can be OK, but for bigger databases you should either [manually tell Zero about the schema change](#schema-change-hooks) or choose a provider with event trigger support.

## Configuration

### WAL Level

The Postgres `wal_level` config parameter has to be set to `logical`. You can check what level your pg has with this command:

```bash
psql -c 'SHOW wal_level'
```

If it doesn’t output `logical` then you need to change the wal level. To do this, run:

```bash
psql -c "ALTER SYSTEM SET wal_level = 'logical';"
```

Then restart Postgres. On most pg systems you can do this like so:

```bash
data_dir=$(psql -t -A -c 'SHOW data_directory')
pg_ctl -D "$data_dir" restart
```

After your server restarts, show the `wal_level` again to ensure it has changed:

```bash
psql -c 'SHOW wal_level'
```

### Bounding WAL Size

For development databases, you can set a `max_slot_wal_keep_size` value in Postgres. This will help limit the amount of WAL kept around.

This is a configuration parameter that bounds the amount of WAL kept around for replication slots, and [invalidates the slots that are too far behind](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-replication.html#GUC-MAX-SLOT-WAL-KEEP-SIZE).

Zero-cache will automatically detect if the replication slot has been invalidated and re-sync replicas from scratch.

This configuration can cause problems like `slot has been invalidated because it exceeded the maximum reserved size` and is not recommended for production databases.

## Provider-Specific Notes

### PlanetScale for Postgres

#### Roles

`zero-cache` should connect using the `default` role that PlanetScale provides, because PlanetScale user-defined roles cannot create replication slots.

#### Connection Limits

Change `max_connections` to at least 100. The default is 25, which is too low for Zero in most configurations.

#### Pooling

Make sure to only use a direct connection for the `ZERO_UPSTREAM_DB`, and use pooled URLs for `ZERO_CVR_DB`, `ZERO_CHANGE_DB`, and your API (see [Deployment](/docs/self-host)).

#### High Availability

PlanetScale Postgres can fail over to a standby during maintenance or an outage. By default a logical replication slot does **not** survive promotion of a standby, so after a failover zero-cache would find its slot missing and re-sync every replica from scratch.

To avoid this, first, run `zero-cache` with [`ZERO_UPSTREAM_PG_REPLICATION_SLOT_FAILOVER=true`](/docs/zero-cache-config#pg-replication-slot-failover) so it creates failover-enabled slots.

Then, run the script below to register Zero's replication slots with PlanetScale and enable the two cluster parameters failover needs:

```bash
APP=""        # your ZERO_APP_ID — on Zero Cloud this is your instance ID
ORG=""        # PlanetScale organization
DB=""         # PlanetScale database
BRANCH="main"
SHARD="0"

if [ -z "$APP" ] || [ -z "$ORG" ] || [ -z "$DB" ]; then
  echo "Set APP, ORG, and DB first — nothing was sent."
elif pscale api -X PATCH "organizations/${ORG}/databases/${DB}/branches/${BRANCH}/changes" --input=- >/dev/null <<EOF
{
  "parameters": {
    "patroni": {
      "slots": [
        "${APP}_${SHARD}_a", "${APP}_${SHARD}_b", "${APP}_${SHARD}_c", "${APP}_${SHARD}_d",
        "${APP}_${SHARD}_e", "${APP}_${SHARD}_f", "${APP}_${SHARD}_g", "${APP}_${SHARD}_h",
        "${APP}_${SHARD}_i", "${APP}_${SHARD}_j", "${APP}_${SHARD}_k", "${APP}_${SHARD}_l",
        "${APP}_${SHARD}_m", "${APP}_${SHARD}_n", "${APP}_${SHARD}_o", "${APP}_${SHARD}_p",
        "${APP}_${SHARD}_q", "${APP}_${SHARD}_r", "${APP}_${SHARD}_s", "${APP}_${SHARD}_t",
        "${APP}_${SHARD}_u", "${APP}_${SHARD}_v", "${APP}_${SHARD}_w", "${APP}_${SHARD}_x",
        "${APP}_${SHARD}_y", "${APP}_${SHARD}_z"
      ]
    },
    "pgconf": {
      "sync_replication_slots": "on",
      "hot_standby_feedback": "on"
    }
  }
}
EOF
then
  echo "Success. Confirm with:"
  echo "  pscale api organizations/${ORG}/databases/${DB}/branches/${BRANCH}/parameters | grep -o '${APP}_${SHARD}_[a-z]'"
else
  echo "Failed — see the error above."
fi
```

> **Why so many slots?**

> Zero only uses a few slots at a time. We register the full `a–z` range with PlanetScale out of conservatism to cover potential issues where a slot doesn't get cleaned up. It also prepares us for potential future Zero versions where multiple replication-managers can run in parallel.

> Registrations don't cost anything if there is no actual slot with the same name.

### Neon

#### Logical Replication

Neon supports logical replication, but you need to enable it in the Neon console for your branch/endpoint.

![Enable logical replication](/images/connecting-to-postgres/neon-enable.png)

#### Branching

Neon fully supports Zero, but you should be aware of how Neon's pricing model and Zero interact: because Zero keeps an open connection to Postgres to replicate changes, as long as zero-cache is running, Postgres will be running and you will be charged by Neon.

For production databases that have enough usage to always be running anyway, this is fine. But for smaller applications that would otherwise not always be running, this can create a surprisingly high bill. You may want to choose a provider that charge a flat monthly rate instead.

Also some users choose Neon because they hope to use branching for previews. This can work, but if not done with care, Zero can end up keeping each Neon _preview_ branch running too 😳.

For the recommended approach to preview URLs, see [Previews](/docs/previews).

### Fly.io

#### Networking

Fly Managed Postgres is the latest offering from Fly.io, and it is private-network-only by default. If zero-cache runs outside Fly, connect via Fly WireGuard or run a proxy like [fly-mpg-proxy](https://github.com/fly-apps/fly-mpg-proxy).

Fly does not support TLS on its private network. If `zero-cache` connects to Postgres over the Fly private network (including WireGuard), add `sslmode=disable` to your connection strings.

#### Permissions

Fly Managed Postgres does not provide superuser access, so `zero-cache` cannot create [event triggers](#event-triggers).

Also, some publication operations (like `FOR TABLES IN SCHEMA ...` / `FOR ALL TABLES`) can be permission-restricted. If `zero-cache` can't create its default publication, create one listing tables explicitly and set the [app publication](/docs/zero-cache-config#app-publications).

#### Pooling

You should use Fly's pgBouncer endpoint for `ZERO_CVR_DB` and `ZERO_CHANGE_DB`.

### Supabase

Supabase requires at least 15.8.1.083 for event trigger support. If you have a lower 15.x, Zero will still work but [schema updates will be slower](#event-triggers). See Supabase's docs for upgrading your Postgres version.

Zero must use the "Direct Connection" string:

<ImageLightbox
  src="/images/connecting-to-postgres/direct.png"
  caption='Use the "Direct Connection" option for ZERO_UPSTREAM_DB.'
  invert="dark"
/>

This is because Zero sets up a logical replication slot, which is only supported with a direct connection.

For `ZERO_CVR_DB` and `ZERO_CHANGE_DB`, prefer Supabase's **session** pooler. The transaction pooler can break prepared statements and cause errors like `26000 prepared statement ... does not exist`.

#### Publication Changes

Supabase [does not fire DDL event triggers](https://github.com/supabase/supautils/issues/123) for `ALTER PUBLICATION`. Call a [schema change hook](#schema-change-hooks) after the `ALTER PUBLICATION` to replicate the change.

#### IPv4

You may also need to assign an IPv4 address to your Supabase instance:

<ImageLightbox
  src="/images/connecting-to-postgres/ipv4.png"
  caption="Assign an IPv4 address if you have trouble connecting from residential internet."
  invert="dark"
/>

This will be required if you
cannot use IPv6 from wherever `zero-cache` is running. Most cloud providers
support IPv6, but some do not. For example, if you are running `zero-cache` in AWS, it is possible to use IPv6 but
difficult. [Hetzner](https://www.hetzner.com/) offers cheap hosted VPS that supports IPv6.

IPv4 addresses are only supported on the Pro plan and are an extra $4/month.

#### High Availability

Zero does not support Supabase's high-availability automatic failover. Supabase does not currently expose the replication-slot failover configuration Zero needs, so a promotion would orphan Zero's replication slot and force a full resync. If you need this, [reach out on Discord](https://discord.rocicorp.dev/).

### Render

Render _can_ work with Zero, but requires admin/support-side setup, and does not support a few core Zero features.

App roles can't create [event triggers](#event-triggers), so schema changes will fall back to full resets unless you use [schema change hooks](#schema-change-hooks).

You also must ensure `wal_level=logical` by creating a Render support ticket.

Render does not provide superuser access, but you can submit another support ticket to ask Render to create a publication with `FOR ALL TABLES` for you, and then set that publication in [App Publications](/docs/zero-cache-config#app-publications).

Zero does not support Render's high availability (HA). Render's standby replicates asynchronously, so a failover can drop the most recent writes — which is incompatible with a sync engine like Zero that must never miss a change. Do not enable HA for a database used as a Zero upstream.

### Google Cloud SQL

Zero works with Google Cloud SQL out of the box. In many configurations, when you connect with a user that has sufficient privileges, `zero-cache` will create its default publication automatically.

If your Cloud SQL user does not have permission to create publications, you can still use Zero by [creating a publication manually](/docs/postgres-support#limiting-replication) and then specifying that publication name in [App Publications](/docs/zero-cache-config#app-publications) when running `zero-cache`.

On Google Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL, enable logical decoding by turning on the instance flag `cloudsql.logical_decoding`.
You do not set `wal_level` directly on Cloud SQL.
See Google's documentation for details: [Configure logical replication](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/postgres/replication/configure-logical-replication).

## Schema Change Hooks

For providers that don't support or allow [event triggers](#event-triggers), Zero provides a manual hook you can call after a schema change to avoid a full reset.

To enable the hook, first opt into manual DDL detection by setting `ddlDetection` to `true` in Zero's upstream shard config. With the default [app id](/docs/zero-cache-config#app-id) of `zero` and the default shard `0`, that looks like:

```sql
UPDATE zero_0."shardConfig" SET "ddlDetection" = true;
```

Then call `update_schemas()` after any DDL statements:

```sql
SELECT zero_0.update_schemas();
```

It is important to call `update_schemas()` after the DDL statements but before any dependent data changes. A good way to do this is to wrap the DDL and the `update_schemas()` call in a single transaction:

```sql
BEGIN;
  ALTER TABLE foo ADD COLUMN bar TEXT;
  CREATE INDEX foo_bar_idx ON foo(bar);
  SELECT zero_0.update_schemas();
COMMIT;
```

> **COMMENT ON PUBLICATION workaround**
>
> You can also tell Zero about publication changes specifically by following the `ALTER PUBLICATION` with a `COMMENT ON PUBLICATION` statement:
>
> ```sql
> ALTER PUBLICATION zero_pub ADD TABLE ...;
> COMMENT ON PUBLICATION zero_pub IS 'anything';
> ```
>
> It is still supported, but was replaced by `update_schemas()` because the latter is catches changes to any DDL, not just publication changes.
