# Inspector

Zero includes a rich inspector API that can help you understand performance or behavior issues you are seeing in your apps.

## Accessing the Inspector

You access the inspector right from the standard developer console in your browser:

<ImageLightbox
  src="/images/debugging/inspector/hello.png"
  caption="Why hello there, inspector!"
/>

For convenience, `Zero` automatically injects itself as `__zero` on the global scope of every Zero app.

> **Password protected in production**
>
> Access to the inspector is gated behind the
>   [`ZERO_ADMIN_PASSWORD`](/docs/zero-cache-config#admin-password) config variable in production (when `NODE_ENV` is set to "production").
>
> We require this variable to be set to a non-empty value in production because we want the inspector enabled in all Zero apps without requiring a restart.

## Clients and Groups

Once you have an inspector, you can inspect the current client and client group. For example to see active queries for the current client:

```ts
let qs = await inspector.client.queries()
console.table(qs)
```

To see active queries for the entire group:

```ts
let qs = await inspector.client.queries()
console.table(qs)
```

> **Clients vs Groups**
>
> In Zero, each instance of the `Zero` class is a *client*. Each client belongs to a *group*, which is a set of clients that share the same `clientGroupID` (typically all clients within a browser profile).
>
> Zero syncs all clients in a group together, so they all see the same data. So if you are debugging performance, you often want to look at the queries for the _group_, since that is what Zero is actually syncing.
>
> But if you are trying to understand when particular queries get added, it's convenient to look at the queries for just the current _client_ so that queries from other clients aren't mixed in.

## Queries

The inspector exposes a bunch of useful information about queries. For example, to see the first query for the current client:

```ts
let qs = await inspector.client.queries()
console.log(qs[0])
```

This outputs something like:

/>

Here are some of the more useful fields:

| Field                                    | Description                                                                                         |
| ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`, `args`                           | The name and arguments of the synced query.                                                         |
| `clientZQL`                              | The client-side ZQL run to give optimistic results.                                                 |
| `serverZQL`                              | The server-side ZQL that your `get-queries` endpoint returned for this query.                       |
| `got`                                    | Whether the first authoritative result has been returned.                                           |
| `hydrateClient`                          | How long the client took to hydrate the first optimistic result.                                    |
| `hydrateServer`                          | How long the server took to hydrate the first authoritative result.                                 |
| `hydrateTotal`                           | Total time to hydrate the first authoritative result, including network.                            |
| `rowCount`                               | Number of rows the query returns.                                                                   |
| `ttl`                                    | The ttl specified when the query was created.                                                       |
| `inactivatedAt`                          | If non-null, the UI is no longer actively using this query, but it's still running due to `ttl`.    |
| `updateClientP50`,<br/>`updateClientP95` | Median and 95th percentile time to update the client-side result after a mutation (optimistically). |
| `updateServerP50`,<br/>`updateServerP95` | Median and 95th percentile time to update the server-side result after a mutation.                  |

## Analyzing Queries

Use the `analyze` method to get information about how a query hydrates:

```ts
await qs[0].analyze()
```

<ImageLightbox
  src="/images/debugging/inspector/analyze.png"
  caption="Analyzing a query"
/>

Here are some of the most useful fields in the output:

| Field                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `elapsed`              | Total time to run the analysis in milliseconds. This is a good proxy for how long the query will take to hydrate in your app.                                                                                                                                                     |
| `dbScansByQuery`       | Number of rows scanned by each SQLite query.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `readRowCount`         | Total number of rows read from the replica to find the synced rows. This is often the most important number for performance, since it reflects how much work Zero has to do to hydrate the query. We generally want this to be a small single-digit multiple of `syncedRowCount`. |
| `readRowCountsByQuery` | Number of rows read by each SQLite query.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `syncedRowCount`       | Number of rows actually synced to the client for this query.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `syncedRows`           | The actual rows synced.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `plans`                | The output from SQLite's [`EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN`](https://www.sqlite.org/eqp.html) for each SQLite query used, which can help you understand why the query is reading more rows than necessary                                                                                      |

## Interpreting Query Analysis

A Zero query is composed of one or more single-table queries connected by joins (`related`, `whereExists`).

Zero delegates the single-table queries to `SQLite`, which has a sophisticated query planner that chooses the best indexes to use. SQLite will _scan_ tables or indexes to find rows to satisfy the single-table query.

Zero then implements its own incremental joins and limits on top of these single-table outputs. It _reads_ rows out of the single-table outputs to satisfy the joins and limits.

Generally, you want the number of rows scanned by SQLite and read into JavaScript by Zero to be small multiples of the number of rows synced to the client. Most Zero query performance problems come from either too many active queries (visible from [`inspector.client.queries()`](#queries)), or queries that scan or read too many rows (visible by looking at the [SQLite](#viewing-sqlite-plans) or [Zero](#viewing-zero-plans) respectively).

## Viewing SQLite Plans

To view the plans selected by `SQLite`, see the `sqlitePlans` field returned by `analyze()` or `analyzeQuery()`. This contains the output of SQLite's [`EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN`](https://www.sqlite.org/eqp.html) command for each SQLite query used:

<ImageLightbox
  src="/images/debugging/inspector/table-plans.png"
  caption="SQLite EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN output"
/>

If SQLite is scanning too many rows, it probably means that SQLite lacks a good index to use. Add the index to Postgres – Zero copies indexes from Postgres to the SQLite replica.

Another common problem visible in SQLite plans is `TEMP B-TREE` entries: SQLite had to build a temporary index to satisfy the `ORDER BY` clause. This is not always a performance problem, but if you see it you can try adding an index with the correct columns (note that Zero adds all primary key columns to the `ORDER BY` clause, so the index must include all primary key columns).

## Viewing Zero Plans

To view the join plan selected by Zero, call `analyze()` or `analyzeQuery()` with the `joinPlans` option set to true and see the `joinPlans` field in the output:

<ImageLightbox
  src="/images/debugging/inspector/join-plans.png"
  caption="Zero join planner output"
/>

This output is mostly useful to the Zero team for debugging query performance problems.

## Analyzing Arbitrary ZQL

You can also analyze arbitrary ZQL, not just queries that are currently active:

```ts
await __zero.inspector.analyzeQuery(
  __builder.issues.whereExists('labels', q =>
    q.id.equals('sync')
  )
)
```

This is useful for exploring alternative query constructions to optimize performance.

To use this, you will first have to expose your `builder` as a property of the global object, so that you can access it from the console. For example:

```ts
// schema.ts
// ...
const g = globalThis as any
g.__builder = builder
```

## Table Data

In addition to information about queries, you can get direct access to the contents of the client side database.

```ts
const client = __zero.inspector.client

// All raw k/v data currently synced to client
console.log('client map:')
console.log(await client.map())

// kv table extracted into tables
// This is same info that is in z.query[tableName].run()
for (const tableName of Object.keys(__zero.schema.tables)) {
  console.log(`table ${tableName}:`)
  console.table(await client.rows(tableName))
}
```

## Server Version

Ask the server to confirm what version it is:

```ts
console.log(
  'server version: ',
  await inspector.serverVersion()
)
```
