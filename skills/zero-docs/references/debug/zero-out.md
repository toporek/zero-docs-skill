# zero-out

Run the `zero-out` tool to completely remove all traces of Zero from your Postgres database. This is useful for debugging issues with Zero and/or resetting to a clean state.

```bash
npx zero-out
```

`zero-out` reads the same [config](/docs/zero-cache-config) as `zero-cache` does, so you can just run it where you run `zero-cache`.
